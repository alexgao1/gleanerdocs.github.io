This is the start of the documents repo for Gleaner.  There are two 
primary branches.

## docs

This branch can be used for editing the documents for review.  

## gh-pages

When happy with the current state of docs, merge it to gh-pages which will
be rendered into the pages at https://docs.gleaner.io
