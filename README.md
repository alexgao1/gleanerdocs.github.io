# gleanerdocs.github.io


This is the start of the documents repo for Gleaner.  There are three branches in this repo.

## main

The default main and a simple branch with its own history.  This is a place for us to store docs
about the docs section itself.  Notes on workflows and the like.

## docs

This branch can be used for editing the documents for review.  A simple shared staging branch where we can 
all work.  No real need to personal branches as a simple pull push process when people work in this branch 
should be fine.

When happy with the docs, simply merge this into gh-pages.

## gh-pages

When happy with the current state of docs, merge it to gh-pages which will then
be rendered into the pages at https://docs.gleaner.io
